# EEE4022S

This repository contains the Python and MATLAB code prepared for the 4022S final year project by Johann√© Jansen van Vuuren (JNSJOH021) at the University of Cape Town.

The scripts included are as follows:
* **get_keypoints.py** takes the OpenPose generated JSON file to create a single text file containing all the skeleton keypoints.
* **calculate_CoM.py** uses the skeleton keypoints to calculate the center of mass (CoM) and will export the CoM values in a .csv file.
  * There are two versions of this program: **M_calculate_CoM.py** is to calculate the CoM for males and **F_calculate_CoM.py** is for females. 
* **get_averages.m** calculates the average velocity, acceleration and power of the CoM trajectory
* **vel_acc_covariance.m** calculates and plots the covariance values for velocity and acceleration
* **pwr_covariance.m** calculates and plots the covariance values for power

### Prerequisites:
The Python programs require the OpenCV library to be installed.
